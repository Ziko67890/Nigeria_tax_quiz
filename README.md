# 📚 Nigeria Tax Quiz App

## 📝 Overview

The **Nigeria Tax Quiz App** is a fun, interactive, and educational mobile application built with **Flutter**. The purpose of this project is to make learning about Nigeria’s tax system both engaging and accessible. Instead of reading through long and complex tax documents, users can test their knowledge through a quiz-style format that breaks tax concepts into bite-sized questions.

This project is also a demonstration of my Flutter development skills, showcasing concepts like widget composition, state management, navigation, and responsive UI design.
